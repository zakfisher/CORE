This repo serves as a starter codebase for data-driven applications.

The core technologies used are:
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Bourbon (SASS Library)](http://bourbon.io/)
* [Bourbon Neat (Grid Framework)](http://neat.bourbon.io/)
* [Epiphany (PHP REST API Framework)](https://github.com/jmathai/epiphany)

This codebase is meant to be lightweight and highly flexible - you are not forced to any of the existing frameworks, they are merely suggestions, so feel free to rip out or add anything you want.

[Here is a guide on Github markdown to help construct a readme file.](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
