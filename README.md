This repo serves as a starter codebase for data-driven applications. The 'dev' directory is meant for development, while the 'build' directory is meant to include minified, concatenated scripts for production. In order to set this up, you'll need to create two spoofy domains for testing - dev.site.com, and build.site.com.

The core technologies used are:

#### JS
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)

#### CSS
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Bourbon (SASS Library)](http://bourbon.io/)
* [Bourbon Neat (Grid Framework)](http://neat.bourbon.io/)

#### PHP
* [Epiphany (PHP REST API Framework)](https://github.com/jmathai/epiphany)

This codebase is meant to be lightweight and highly flexible - you are not forced to use any of the existing frameworks, they are merely suggestions, so feel free to rip out or add anything you want.
